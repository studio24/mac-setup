# How to setup a Mac for a user

## Management tools

This process uses the following platforms to manage automated deployment.

### Apple Business Manager

[Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com/) is the central portal for setting up and managing:

* App Store licences for Studio 24
* Devices owned by Studio 24

### Addigy

All Mac devices are enrolled into [Addigy](https://prod.addigy.com/), which manages the policies used for deploying uniform settings and software to Studio 24 devices. It also allows for centralised reporting, management and software deployment.

### Automated device setup

All Mac systems are automatically added to this process when purchased from Apple. Other MacOS and iOS systems can be added via Serial or Order number via the Apple Business Manager. Systems that are auto enrolled to this service will automatically download the agent and deploy according to the policy attached to them.

## New Mac setup

* Boot up the new machine
* Select you location/region
* Connect to Wi-fi (if you in the office please ask a team member to help you with the credentials)
* Confirm Addigy/Studio 24 management
* Add the user a standard account \(username should be in the format initial + last name, i.e. _sjones_\)
* Setup Touch ID
* Choose your look light/dark
* Choose True Tone display yes/no
* Enable Location Services to set Date/Time 

### Addigy

All of the major software is installed \(and updated\) automatically by Addigy in the background. These can take a while to download based upon network speed. Please check progress via Launchpad.

* Microsoft To Do
* Microsoft Remote Desktop
* 1Password 7 \(Requires Simon or Julie to add new users if required\)
* Tick \(Time & Budget Tracking\)
* Integrity
* Slack
* SonicWall Mobile Connect
* Alfred
* Sequel Ace 
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Office 
* Microsoft Teams 
* Mozilla Firefox
* Amiko Font

### Additional settings automatically added

This process also:

* Creates a default admin user (see below for additional actions)
* Adds office printers
* Sets up default finder and preferences

## Setup email
* Open the Mail app
* Select Other Mail account
* Ensure your Name, Email Address and Password are filled in. (The support team can provide this information if you do not have it)
* On the next screen ensure the account type is IMAP and both Incoming and Outgoing swerver details are set as secure.emailsrvr.com
* Tick 'Mail' and Done
* Select Protect Mail Activity and continue

You can setup your email signature once your have intranet access via 
[Email signature](https://intranet.studio24.net/staff/email-signature)
Copy and paste this into your Mail client (Preferences, Signatures).

## Setup 1Password
Once you have email access you should have an invitation to 1Password. If you haven't recieved this please contact Simon or Julie to add your user.

## Setting up additional software
Invitations to use other software packages will be sent to your email account. Please add all login details to your Private Vault in 1Password.

### Default admin user

To meet our security requirements your normal user does not have admin rights. To perform any admin tasks (e.g. install software) you need to use the admin user.

At the earliest opportunity, request that the support team change the password for the default admin user. 
You should then:

1) log in as the user 'admin' using this password 
2) Change the password to a new strong passwword
3) Store the new admin password in your 'Private/Personal' vault in 1Password
This account is used for additional authentication as required.
  
For further information see [User accounts](it-guidelines/user-accounts.md)

## Setup steps for Support team

Once a new Mac has passed the intial setup, the support team need to action the following.

These commands are carried out within the [Addigy portal](https://prod.addigy.com):
  
* Setup Device Name via device facts
* Setup asset tag
* Setup Finder & Firmware password via 'Script' deployment

**Note:** Macbooks running the M1 chip do not require a firrmware password as they have an additonal process built in to replace it. 

### Gatekeeper

When installing programs if you get a message saying the application _"can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"_ this is the macOS Gatekeeper program restricting what can be installed.

To manually override this hold **Ctrl** while opening the application, then will then bring up a dialog box where you can select OK to open the application.
