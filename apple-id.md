# Apple ID

Apple IDs are a requirement for getting support for an Apple Mac. 

## Setting up a new Apple ID

If you don't already have an Apple ID using your Studio 24 email, you will receive an invitation via email containing: 

* Your managed Apple ID, e.g. user@studio24.net
* Your temporary password

You should then reset your password:

* Click the link in the email or visit the URL [Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com)
* Enter your Apple ID
* Enter your temporary password
* Add a telephone number, this is used for verification when logging in
* Verify your telehone
* Create a new password
* Store the new password in your Employee vault in 1Password
* Verify your email

## Login to your Mac with your Apple ID

Once the Apple ID is setup, login with it on your Mac:

* Open System Preferences
* Go to Sign in with your Apple account
* Enter your Apple ID, e.g. user@studio24.net
* Enter your password
* If you are moving to a new Mac, you'll need to authorise this on your old Mac
* Enter your Mac user password to confirm this
