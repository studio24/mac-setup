# Design team setup 

## Figma

Figma is our primary design tool.

We use Figma in the cloud, so you'll need to be connected to the internet to access the full functionality. 

### Setup
 * You will receive an email invitation to signup to Figma.
 * Simply use the link within the email to signup.
 * Store your password within your Personal vault within 1Password.

### Backups 
As Figma is cloudbased the files are contantly backed up within the Figma service. We also use a secondary backup service [XD2Sketch](https://xd2sketch.com/pricing#backup).


### Offline use
If you need to work offline, you can cache the files you need by opening them in Figma before you go offlline. Your changes will sync and back up, when you go back online. The offline functionality is limited [read more](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040328553-Can-I-work-offline-with-Figma-)

## Sketch

Sketch is our secondary design tool.

Sketch is mainly used for accessing legacy design files. Unlike Figma we mainly use Sketch locally rather than via the cloud.

### Setup 
 * A licence will be assigned to you.
 * Download the latest version of Sketch and install

### Backups
As we work on Sketch files locally, ensure that you have saved any work **daily** within Google Drive so that it is automatically backed up.
